# tools/lint-skills — SKILL.md corruption lint

A small offline linter that catches the class of failures that escaped REQ-424
verify: literal-but-broken shell constructs embedded in skill prose. It is NOT
a general markdown linter and NOT a general shell linter.

## What it checks

1. **Sentinel literals** — exact substrings listed in `sentinels.txt` should
   never appear in any `SKILL.md`. Seeded with the REQ-424 corruption
   sequence; one line per known-bad pattern.
2. **Shell-construct balance** — within each ` ```sh `, ` ```bash `, or
   ` ```shell ` fenced block, the linter counts `$(` vs `)` and `$((` vs
   `))`. Imbalance is a finding. Outside-fence text is ignored (skill prose
   may legitimately use unbalanced examples).
3. **Canonical-helper presence** — any SKILL.md that contains
   `ADLC_DISABLE_KIMI` (i.e., has a Kimi delegation gate) must also contain
   four exact literals:
   - `command -v ask-kimi >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ "${ADLC_DISABLE_KIMI:-0}" != "1" ]`
   - `start_s=$(date -u +%s)`
   - `duration_ms=$(( ($(date -u +%s) - $start_s) * 1000 ))`
   - `tools/kimi/emit-telemetry.sh ` (note the trailing space)

   Each missing literal is a separate finding.

## Usage

```sh
# From the repo root
python3 tools/lint-skills/check.py
# or
sh tools/lint-skills/check.sh
```

Exit code is `0` on a clean pass, otherwise `min(findings, 255)`. Findings are
written to stdout in the format `<file>:<line>: <check-name>: <message>`.

`/analyze` runs the same check at Step 1.9 and surfaces results as a
`skill-md-corruption` audit dimension.

## Adding a new sentinel

A new corruption shape escaped detection? Append one literal line to
`sentinels.txt`. Comments (`#`-prefixed) and blank lines are ignored. The
linter picks up the new sentinel on its next run — no code changes needed.

## Tests

```sh
pytest tools/lint-skills/tests/ -q
```

Or run together with the kimi suite:

```sh
pytest tools/kimi/tests/ tools/lint-skills/tests/ -q
```

## Constraints

- Python 3 stdlib only (`argparse`, `re`, `pathlib`, `sys`). No third-party
  packages. No network.
- POSIX `sh`-compatible wrapper. Tested on macOS and Linux.
- Read-only against the repo. No temp files, no logs, no cache.
