# Conventions — ADLC Toolkit

## Code is markdown, not code

Every skill and agent is a markdown file. No TypeScript, no Python, no package.json. Claude Code interprets the markdown at invocation time. This matters:

- **No build step**: edits take effect immediately via the symlink install
- **No test runner**: "tests" are dogfooding — invoke the skill on a real REQ and see if it produces the expected artifacts
- **Linting is minimal**: markdown formatting, frontmatter validity, and bash syntax in `!`...`` macros. Nothing else.

**Exception — `tools/`:** the `tools/` directory may contain real executable code (e.g. `tools/kimi/`, a set of Python delegation CLIs with its own `install.sh`). It is exempt from the markdown-only rule and from the symlink-install model — those tools are installed by running their `install.sh`, not via the skills symlink. Each `tools/<name>/` subdirectory carries its own README.

## File and directory naming

- Skill directories: lowercase, single word or hyphenated (`spec`, `bugfix`, `template-drift`)
- Skill files: always `SKILL.md` (uppercase, singular) inside the skill directory
- Agent files: `agents/<agent-name>.md`, hyphenated lowercase
- Templates: `templates/<artifact>-template.md`
- IDs: `REQ-xxx` (zero-padded to 3 digits), `TASK-yyy`, `BUG-zzz`, `LESSON-nnn` — always uppercase prefix, always 3 digits minimum
- Slugs: lowercase kebab-case, ≤6 words, no dates, no bare numbers

## Frontmatter conventions

All artifact types use YAML frontmatter. Dates in ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Arrays use JSON inline syntax (`tags: [a, b, c]`). Status enum values are lowercase strings.

**Required vs optional** varies per template. Generally: `id`, `title`, `status`, `created` are required; everything else is optional. When adding new fields, prefer additive — do not rename existing fields without a migration plan.

## Ethos injection pattern

Every skill begins with:

```markdown
## Ethos

!`cat .adlc/ETHOS.md 2>/dev/null || cat ~/.claude/skills/ETHOS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No ethos found"`
```

The fallback chain is deliberate: consumer-project copy first (may be customized), then toolkit-root fallback, then graceful failure message. Never hardcode the ethos body inside a skill — always reference `ETHOS.md`.

## Context loading pattern

Skills load context via `!bash` macros under a `## Context` section. Use the same fallback chain: prefer consumer-project `.adlc/...`, fall back to `~/.claude/skills/...`. Example:

```markdown
- Conventions: !`cat .adlc/context/conventions.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No conventions found"`
```

Never hardcode paths; always allow the skill to degrade gracefully when a file is absent.

## Prerequisites block

Every skill that depends on the `.adlc/` scaffold must have a `## Prerequisites` section that stops with a clear "run `/init` first" message if required files are missing. Do not silently produce broken output when context is absent.

## Bash in skills

- Keep bash minimal — prefer Claude's own tool calls (Read, Grep, Glob, Edit, Write) over shell
- Bash is fine for deterministic operations: counter increments, directory creation, git commands, file globbing
- **POSIX-only**: no GNU-specific flags. Use `grep -oE` (not `-oP`), use `mkdir` locks (not `flock`), use `sed 's/old/new/'` not `-i ''` on macOS directly — prefer `perl` for in-place edits or write a temp file
- Quote file paths with spaces: `"$path"`
- Avoid `cd` — prefer absolute paths so commands work from any working directory

## Agent dispatch patterns

- **Parallel review**: dispatch 5–6 review agents in a single message (`correctness-reviewer`, `quality-reviewer`, `architecture-reviewer`, `test-auditor`, `security-auditor`, `reflector`). Read-only mandate: every agent must be told "Report findings only. Do not apply fixes."
- **Parallel implementation**: `task-implementer` agents dispatched one per independent task. Group into dependency tiers.
- **Subagent mode**: when a skill runs inside a subagent (e.g., via `/sprint`'s `pipeline-runner`), do NOT dispatch further subagents. Execute sequentially in-context instead.

## Pipeline state

Skills that span multiple phases (`/proceed`) write a `pipeline-state.json` next to the REQ spec. This lets a long-running pipeline resume from interruption without replaying phases. Every phase update writes the state file atomically.

## Commits and branches

- Branch naming: `feat/REQ-xxx-short-description` for features, `fix/bug-xxx-short-description` for bugs
- Commit message format: `<type>(<scope>): <description> [TASK-xxx]` — types are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
- The TASK-xxx (or REQ-xxx) trailer is required for work tracked through the pipeline
- Co-author trailer is added by Claude Code automatically when committing on behalf of the user

## What NOT to do

- **Don't create new skill directories casually**: each new skill is a commitment to maintain. Prefer extending an existing skill unless the new responsibility is genuinely orthogonal.
- **Don't bypass ethos**: the five principles (especially #4 Verify, Don't Trust and #5 Process Is Not Optional) exist because shortcuts silently fail. If you're tempted to skip a validation gate or add a `--no-verify` flag, surface the tension to the user instead.
- **Don't duplicate context loading logic**: if the same bash macro appears in three skills, it's a candidate for a helper pattern (though the toolkit has not yet introduced one).
- **Don't hardcode project-specific paths**: skills must work for any consumer project, not just atelier-fashion.
- **Don't edit `templates/` without considering downstream**: consumer projects that ran `/init` got a copy of the templates. Template changes propagate via `/template-drift` detection, not auto-update.

## Testing changes

Because this is a symlink-install, there is no staging layer. To validate a skill change:

1. Commit the change in this repo
2. Open a Claude Code session in a consumer project (atelier-fashion is the primary test bed)
3. Invoke the changed skill on a real or synthetic REQ
4. Verify the artifacts it produces match the intended behavior
5. Revert if it breaks

The toolkit's own `/proceed REQ-xxx` pipeline can also exercise changes end-to-end, as in REQ-258.
