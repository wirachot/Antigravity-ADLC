# /canary — Canary Deployment with Smoke Tests

You are deploying code through a canary process: deploy a zero-traffic revision, verify it works, then promote to live traffic. This prevents broken deploys from reaching users.

## Ethos

!`cat ~/.claude/skills/ETHOS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No ethos found"`

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repo"`
- GCP project: !`gcloud config get-value project 2>/dev/null || echo "No GCP project configured"`
- Active Cloud Run services: !`gcloud run services list --format="table(SERVICE,REGION,URL)" 2>/dev/null || echo "gcloud not configured"`

## Input

Target: $ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

1. `gcloud` CLI must be authenticated and configured with the correct project
2. The service must already exist on Cloud Run (this skill deploys revisions, not new services)
3. A Docker image must be available (either build locally or use the latest from Artifact Registry)

## Service Detection

Map the current repo/directory to Cloud Run service configuration:

| Repo / Directory | Service Name | Region | Image Path |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|------------|
| `atelier-fashion/api` or `atelier-fashion` | `fashion-api` | `us-central1` | `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/sharp-maker-488811-g1/fashion-api/fashion-api` |
| `admin-api` | `admin-api` | `us-central1` | `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/sharp-maker-488811-g1/admin-api/admin-api` |
| `atelier-web` | `atelier-web` | `us-central1` | `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/sharp-maker-488811-g1/atelier-web/atelier-web` |

If the argument specifies a service name, use that. Otherwise, detect from the current working directory.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Build and Push Image

1. Determine the image tag: use the current git SHA (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`)
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <IMAGE_PATH>:canary-<SHA> ./<subdir if needed>
   ```
3. Push to Artifact Registry:
   ```bash
   docker push <IMAGE_PATH>:canary-<SHA>
   ```

If the user says "use latest" or the image was already built by CI, skip the build and use the `:latest` tag from Artifact Registry.

### Step 2: Deploy Canary Revision (Zero Traffic)

Deploy a new revision that receives NO traffic:

```bash
gcloud run deploy <SERVICE_NAME> \
  --image=<IMAGE_PATH>:canary-<SHA> \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --no-traffic \
  --tag=canary \
  --format="json"
```

This creates a tagged revision accessible at `https://canary---<SERVICE_NAME>-<hash>.a.run.app` without affecting production traffic.

Capture the canary URL from the output.

### Step 3: Health Checks

Run basic health checks against the canary URL:

1. **Liveness**: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" <CANARY_URL>/health`
   - Expected: `200`
   - Retry up to 3 times with 5-second intervals (cold start grace period)

2. **Readiness**: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" <CANARY_URL>/api/health`
   - Expected: `200` (or the service's documented readiness endpoint)

If health checks fail after 3 retries, go to Step 6 (Rollback).

### Step 4: Smoke Tests

Run smoke tests against the canary URL. Load test definitions from `.adlc/context/smoke-tests.md` if it exists, otherwise use defaults:

**Default smoke tests** (API services):
```
GET  /health              -> 200
GET  /api/health          -> 200
```

**Custom smoke tests** (from `.adlc/context/smoke-tests.md`):
Each entry should specify: method, path, expected status, optional body pattern.

For each test:
```bash
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" <CANARY_URL><PATH>)
STATUS=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | tail -1)
BODY=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | head -n -1)
```

Report results:
```
## Smoke Test Results

| Test | Method | Path | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|--------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Health | GET | /health | 200 | 200 | PASS |
| API Health | GET | /api/health | 200 | 200 | PASS |

Result: 2/2 passed
```

If any test fails, go to Step 6 (Rollback).

### Step 5: Promote to Production

All checks passed — promote the canary revision to 100% traffic:

```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic <SERVICE_NAME> \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --to-tags=canary=100
```

Verify promotion:
```bash
gcloud run services describe <SERVICE_NAME> \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --format="table(status.traffic[].percent,status.traffic[].revisionName,status.traffic[].tag)"
```

Confirm canary revision is now serving 100% traffic.

Remove the canary tag (clean up):
```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic <SERVICE_NAME> \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --remove-tags=canary
```

Report:
```
Canary promoted to production.
Service: <SERVICE_NAME>
Revision: <REVISION_NAME>
URL: <PRODUCTION_URL>
All smoke tests passed.
```

### Step 6: Rollback (Failure Path)

If health checks or smoke tests fail:

1. Delete the canary revision tag (so it's not addressable):
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update-traffic <SERVICE_NAME> \
     --region=us-central1 \
     --remove-tags=canary
   ```

2. Report the failure:
   ```
   CANARY FAILED — rolled back.
   Service: <SERVICE_NAME>
   Failed revision: canary-<SHA>

   Failures:
   - [list failed health checks or smoke tests]

   Production traffic is unchanged — still serving the previous revision.
   ```

3. Suggest next steps:
   - Check Cloud Run logs: `gcloud run services logs read <SERVICE_NAME> --region=us-central1 --limit=50`
   - Investigate the failure locally
   - Fix and re-run `/canary`

### Step 7: Update Pipeline State (if in /proceed context)

If `pipeline-state.json` exists for the current REQ:
1. Add a `canary` entry to `phaseHistory` with the result (passed/failed)
2. Include: service name, revision, smoke test results, canary URL

## Smoke Test Configuration

To customize smoke tests, create `.adlc/context/smoke-tests.md` with this format:

```markdown
# Smoke Tests

## fashion-api
| Method | Path | Expected Status | Body Pattern |
|--------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| GET | /health | 200 | |
| GET | /api/health | 200 | |
| GET | /api/v1/config | 200 | "version" |

## admin-api
| Method | Path | Expected Status | Body Pattern |
|--------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| GET | /health | 200 | |
| GET | /api/health | 200 | |

## atelier-web
| Method | Path | Expected Status | Body Pattern |
|--------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| GET | / | 200 | |
| GET | /api/health | 200 | |
```

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- It does not create new Cloud Run services — the service must already exist
- It does not handle iOS deployments — TestFlight is already a canary-like process
- It does not modify CI/CD workflows — it's a manual deployment confidence tool
- It does not handle database migrations — run those separately before deploying
